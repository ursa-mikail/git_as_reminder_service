# Step-by-Step Guide to Using GitHub Actions for Reminders
Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository (if you donâ€™t have one already)
Create a new repository on GitHub where you want to set up your reminders.

Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
Navigate to the Actions tab in your repository.
Click on "New workflow" and then on "set up a workflow yourself".

Step 3: Define the Workflow
Create a YAML file for your workflow. This file will define the schedule and actions that will create reminders.

```yaml
name: Create Reminder Issues

on:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 9 AM every day
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: # This allows you to manually trigger the workflow

jobs:
  create-reminder:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Create Reminder Issue
      uses: ursa-mikail/create-issue-from-file@v4
      with:
        title: 'Daily Reminder'
        content-filepath: '.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/reminder.md'
        labels: reminder
```

Step 4: Create a Template for the Issue
Create a template for the issues that will be generated. Create a directory structure .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/reminder.md and put the content of the issue in the reminder.md file.

```
## Daily Reminder

This is your daily reminder to check on the tasks and progress for the day.

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

**Please make sure to update the status of your tasks.**
```

Step 5: Commit and Push the Workflow
Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository. The workflow will now run every day at 9 AM UTC, creating an issue titled "Daily Reminder" with the content specified in your template.

## Caveats:

```
As the workflow may not be stable, it is good to set 2 tasks at least:
1. 1 as a liveness test (as confirmation liveness test)
2. the 2nd is the actual task

```
